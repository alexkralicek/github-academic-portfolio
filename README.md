This repository (aka. a repo; a central storage for your project's files, folders, and version history) has all the files and instructions to build a basic academic portfolio website with a home page, a teaching page, a research page, and a link to a CV [PDF].

>I recommend using Google Chrome for this exercise so you can easily use the Developer tools like "View Source" and "Inspect Elements".

## What is GitHub?

GitHub is a platform for sharing code that combines many useful tools: git (version control), Codespaces (virtual coding environment), and Pages (free web hosting). 

## Why would I use GitHub?

If you’re thinking about ways to 
1) code collaboratively, or 
2) share your code with an online community, or 
3) create your own website, 
this introduction is for you.

## How can I use GitHub?

In this workshop, we will create GitHub accounts, learn the terms used to build foundational understanding, navigate the interface, create a simple static website using GitHub, and discuss the benefits and drawbacks of this platform.

## Create GitHub account

Navigate to https://github.com/.
Click Sign up.
Follow the prompts to create your personal account.
Email
Password (Password should be at least 15 characters OR at least 8 characters including a number and a lowercase letter.) 
Username* (Username may only contain alphanumeric characters or single hyphens, and cannot begin or end with a hyphen. (NOTE: You will want to pick a professional username because it will be in all of your URLs))

Create Account>

(During sign up, you'll be asked to verify your email address. Without a verified email address, you won't be able to complete some basic GitHub tasks, such as creating a repository.)


## GitHub Glossary

repo- repository for project storage
branch- a parallel version of a repository
local- this is your personal computer
remote- this is the version of a repository or branch that is hosted on a server, most likely GitHub.com
clone- a clone is a copy of a repository that lives on your computer
fork- a fork is a personal copy of another user's repository that lives on your account
commit- a saved change or revision
commit message- short, descriptive text that communicates the change the commit is introducing
pull- fetch changes from remote and merge them
push- send your committed changes to a remote repository on GitHub.com
collaborator- someone with read and write access

## GitHub Statistics

GitHub is a company that was acquired by Microsoft that hosts git (version control) projects online.
 
100 million + accounts
400 million + repositories
More than 90% of Fortune 100 companies now use GitHub in their development workflows.

## GitHub Pages

GitHub is a company that was acquired by Microsoft that hosts git (version control) projects online. GitHub created [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), a way to host static sites for free, usually hosted at https://_username_.github.io/_repository_. This means that they are providing free _hosting_, meaning the server space to hold all your files and a free _domain_, the address/URL where others can navigate to your content. 

## GitHub Codespaces

Based on Microsoft’s Visual Studio Code, GitHub also developed [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces), a staging area that combines the functionality of a file **Explorer**, allowing you to visualize your folder structure, a code **Editor**, allowing you to make updates, a **Source Control**, allowing you to push and pull changes from your local to remote repository, and a **Terminal**, allowing you to run actions like previewing a demo of your site on a locally hosted address.

>Typically coders using GitHub use their favorite text editor like [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/), [Atom](https://atom-editor.cc/), or [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), and then use a graphical user interface (GUI) like [GitHub Desktop](https://github.com/apps/desktop) or their command-line interface (CLI) like **Terminal** to push and pull changes to their project. GitHub created Codespaces to allow you to do both of those things right in the browser without having to download software applications (so you can do all of this on your iPad if you want!) 


## Fork GitHub Repository

1. Either search for github-academic-portfolio in the search bar 
OR
Navigate to this URL in your web browser
[https://github.com/Makeademic/github-academic-portfolio](https://github.com/Makeademic/github-academic-portfolio) 
2. Find and select the "Fork" button near the top right
OPTIONAL: You can rename the repository for your own account
3. Select the green 🟩 "Create fork" button
[Create a GitHub account](https://github.com/signup) if you do not already have one. (NOTE: You will want to pick a professional username because it will be in all of your URLs)
3. Navigate back to [this repository](https://github.com/Makeademic/dream-lab-blog/) and click the green 🟩 "Use this template" button and then "Create a new repository"
4. Type a name for your new repository (NOTE: lowercase and no spaces is best for URLs with hyphens or underscores separating each word)
5. Select "Public" repository visibility and you only need to include the "main" branch (We will build the gh-pages branch in a later step)
6. Click the green 🟩 "Create repository from template" button

**Review**
So far, what we have done is created a copy of a public project on our individual accounts so that we can edit and make changes to the files

## Setting Up Your Project in GitHub Codespaces

 

1. On your repository's homepage, click the green 🟩 "Code" button and switch from the "Local" to the "Codespaces" tab. Then click the green 🟩 "Create codespace on main" button.
2. This will open up a new tab in your browser and will take some time, so be patient with it. [NOTE: As of authoring this document, GitHub provides 60 free hours of Codespaces every month]
3. You should see the **Explorer** on the left (this helps you see folder hierarchy), the **Editor** on the right (this is where you can edit the code), and the **Terminal** at the bottom (this is where we will provide instructions for building our project). The far left toolbar will let you switch between options: **Explorer**, **Search**, **Source Control**, **Run and Debug**, **Extensions**, and **GitHub**.
4. In the **Explorer** (stacked pages icon), navigate to `_data/metadata.js` and double-click to open the file in the **Editor** space. Change the title, URL (https://username.github.io/repositoryname), description, and author data.
5. In the **Terminal**, install dependencies (the needed files for this version of the project) by copying and pasting the code below and then pressing enter/return.
```
npm install
```
6. You should see new lines of text being generated in the **Terminal**.

## Editing Files in Your Project

### Previewing Changes
1. If you want to see a local test of your site before you put it on the web, copy and paste the following code in the **Terminal**
```
npx @11ty/eleventy --serve
```
2. Command + click on the local link to view a preview of your site in a new browser tab
3. This process will be constantly running, so any changes you make in the editor will populate in the 
> Note: Type Control+C in the **Terminal** to terminate the command if you don't want it running in the background.

### Editing Text
>Your text files will be in the "content" folder, your assets like images and documents will be in the "public" folder, and your styling will be in the "css" folder. Some file extensions you will want to know are: 
>- .html (Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for **documents** designed to be displayed in a **web** browser)
>- .css (Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for specifying the presentation and **styling** of a document written in a markup language such as HTML)
>- .js (JavaScript (JS) is the programming language for creating interactive, dynamic websites)
>- .md (Markdown is a lightweight markup language for creating formatted text using a **plain-text** editor)
>- .njk (Nunjucks is a templating language for JavaScript)
>- .svg (Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) is an XML-based vector graphics format for defining two-dimensional graphics, having support for interactivity and animation)
>- .jpg (jpg or jpeg, short for Joint Photographic Experts Group, is a compressed image format used for photos)
>- .ico (short for icon, this file format is for square icons like the favicon in your browser tab, can be based on a transparent .png (Portable Network Graphics))

## Push Changes to GitHub and Run Eleventy to Create Site

1. In the toolbar to the left of the **Explorer**, go to **Source Control** (branch icon with 3 circles).
2. Write a short description of the changes you plan to "commit" from this local Codespaces copy of your repository to the remote copy of the repository that is publicly available at github.com/username/repository/
3. Click the blue 🟦 "Commit" button and answer Yes to any pop-up boxes.
4. In the **Terminal**, use the node package manager command npx (Node Package eXecute) to run eleventy, which will convert your markdown and nunjucks files to html files, by copying and pasting the code below and then pressing enter/return.
```
npx @11ty/eleventy
```
5. You should see new lines of text being generated in the **Terminal**. You may need to troubleshoot any errors.



## Deploy to GitHub Pages

1. Exit Codespaces and return to the main branch of your repository at github.com/username/repository.
2. Click on the ".github/workflows/" folder link
3. Click on the "gh-pages.yml.sample" link
4. Select the pencil icon in the toolbar to edit this file
5. At the top in the breadcrumbs (a graphical element showcasing folder hierarchy), edit the title "gh-pages.yml.sample" to "gh-pages.yml" and select the green 🟩 "Commit changes..." button
6. Navigate to Actions and you will see that the gh-pages branch is being created
7. Once the gh-pages branch is finished, navigate to Settings>Pages
8. Change the branch from None to gh-pages and click the "Save" button
9. Navigate back to Actions and you can see your site being built
10. Once you have the green ✅ checkmark, navigate back to Settings>Pages and you should see a link in a message that says "Your site is live at https://username.github.io/repository/"
11. Now that the gh-pages.yml is running, every time you commit a new change to your GitHub repo, it will build and deploy your changes to your gh-pages branch and your github.io site. 

 
### Implementation Notes
- The `public` folder in your input directory will be copied to the output folder (via `addPassthroughCopy` in the `eleventy.config.js` file). This means that anything in your public folder will live in your gh-pages branch after your build completes.
